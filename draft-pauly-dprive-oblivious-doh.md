--- abstract

This document describes an extension to DNS Over HTTPS (DoH) that allows hiding
client IP addresses via proxying encrypted DNS transactions. This improves privacy of
DNS operations by not allowing any one server entity to be aware of both the client IP
address and the content of DNS queries and answers.

--- middle

# Introduction

DNS Over HTTPS (DoH) {{!RFC8484}} defines a mechanism to allow DNS messages to be
transmitted in encrypted HTTP messages. This provides improved confidentiality and authentication
for DNS interactions in various circumstances.

While DoH can prevent eavesdroppers from directly reading the contents of DNS exchanges,
clients cannot send DNS queries and receive answers from servers without revealing
their local IP address, and thus information about the identity or location of the client.

Proposals such as Oblivious DNS ({{?I-D.annee-dprive-oblivious-dns}}) increase privacy
by ensuring no single DNS server is aware of both the client IP address and the message
contents.

This document defines Oblivious DoH, an extension to DoH that permits proxied resolution,
in which DNS messages are encrypted so that no DoH server can independently read both the
client IP address and the DNS message contents.

This mechanism is intended to be used as one option for resolving privacy-sensitive content
in the broader context of Adaptive DNS {{!I-D.pauly-dprive-adaptive-dns-privacy}}.

## Specification of Requirements

{::boilerplate bcp14}

# Terminology

This document defines the following terms:

Oblivious Server:
: A DoH server that acts as either an Oblivious Proxy or Oblivious Target.

Oblivious Proxy:
: An Oblivious Server that proxies encrypted DNS queries and responses between a client and an
Oblivious Target.

Oblivious Target:
: An Oblivious Server that receives and decrypts encrypted client DNS queries from an Oblivious Proxy,
and returns encrypted DNS responses via that same Proxy. In order to provide DNS responses, the Target
can be a DNS resolver, be co-located with a resolver, or forward to a resolver.

Throughout the rest of this document, we use the terms Proxy and Target to refer to an Oblivious
Proxy and Oblivious Target, respectively.

# Deployment Requirements

Oblivious DoH requires, at a minimum:

- Two Oblivious Servers, where one can act as a Proxy, and the other can act as a Target.
- Public keys for encrypting DNS queries that are passed from a client through a Proxy
  to a Target ({{publickey}}). These keys guarantee that only the intended Target can
  decrypt client queries.

The mechanism for discovering and provisioning the DoH URI Templates and public keys
is via parameters added to DNS resource records. The mechanism for discovering the public
key is described in {{keydiscovery}}. The mechanism for discovering a DoH URI Template is
described in {{!I-D.pauly-add-resolver-discovery}}.

# HTTP Exchange

Unlike direct resolution, oblivious hostname resolution over DoH involves three parties:

1. The Client, which generates queries.
2. The Proxy, which receives encrypted queries from the client and passes them on to a Target.
3. The Target, which receives proxied queries from the client via the Proxy and produces proxied
   answers.

{: #fig-doh-exchange title="Obvlivious DoH Exchange"}

## HTTP Request {#oblivious-request}

Oblivious DoH queries are created by the Client, and sent to the Proxy.
Requests to the Proxy indicate which DoH server to use as a Target by
specifying two variables: "targethost", which indicates the host name of
the Target server, and "targetpath", which indicates the path on which
the Target's DoH server is running. See {{request-example}} for an
example request.

Oblivious DoH messages have no cache value since both requests and responses are
encrypted using ephemeral key material. Clients SHOULD prefer using HTTP methods and
headers that will prevent unhelpful cache storage of these exchanges (i.e., preferring POST
instead of GET).

Clients MUST set the HTTP Content-Type header to "application/oblivious-dns-message"
to indicate that this request is an Oblivious DoH query intended for proxying. Clients also SHOULD
set this same value for the HTTP Accept header.

Upon receiving a request that contains a "application/oblivious-dns-message" Content-Type,
the DoH server looks for the "targethost" and "targetpath" variables. If the variables are not
present, then it is the target of the query, and it can decrypt the query ({{encryption}}).
If the variables are present, then the DoH server is acting as a Proxy.
If it is a proxy, it is expected to send the request on to the Target
using the URI template constructed as "https://targethost/targetpath".

## HTTP Request Example {#request-example}

The following example shows how a client requests that a Proxy, "dnsproxy.example.net",
forwards an encrypted message to "dnstarget.example.net". The URI template for the
Proxy is "https://dnsproxy.example.net/dns-query{?targethost,targetpath}". The URI template for
the Target is "https://dnstarget.example.net/dns-query".

~~~
:method = POST
:scheme = https
:authority = dnsproxy.example.net
:path = /dns-query?targethost=dnstarget.example.net&targetpath=/dns-query
accept = application/oblivious-dns-message
cache-control = no-cache, no-store
content-type = application/oblivious-dns-message
content-length = 106

<Bytes containing the encrypted payload for an Oblivious DNS query>
~~~

The Proxy then sends the following request on to the Target:

~~~
:method = POST
:scheme = https
:authority = dnstarget.example.net
:path = /dns-query
accept = application/oblivious-dns-message
cache-control = no-cache, no-store
content-type = application/oblivious-dns-message
content-length = 106

<Bytes containing the encrypted payload for an Oblivious DNS query>
~~~

## HTTP Response {#oblivious-response}

The response to an Oblivious DoH query is generated by the Target. It MUST set the
Content-Type HTTP header to "application/oblivious-dns-message" for all successful responses.
The body of the response contains a DNS message that is encrypted with the client's symmetric key ({{encryption}}).

The response from a Target MUST set the Content-Type HTTP header to "application/oblivious-dns-message" which
MUST be forwarded by the Proxy to the Client. A Client MUST only consider a response which contains the
Content-Type header in the response before processing the payload. A response without the appropriate header MUST be
treated as an error and be handled appropriately. All other aspects of the HTTP response and error handling are
inherited from standard DoH.

## HTTP Response Example

The following example shows a 2xx (Successful) response that can be sent from a Target to
a client via a Proxy.

~~~
:status = 200
content-type = application/oblivious-dns-message
content-length = 154

<Bytes containing the encrypted payload for an Oblivious DNS response>
~~~

Requests that cannot be processed by the target result in 4xx (Client Error) responses. If the target and client keys do not match, it is an authorization failure (HTTP status code 401; see Section 3.1 of {{!RFC7235}}). Otherwise, if the client's request is invalid, such as in the case of decryption failure, wrong message type, or deserialization failure, this is a bad request (HTTP status code 400; see Section 6.5.1 of {{!RFC7231}}). 

Even in case of DNS responses indicating failure, such as SERVFAIL or NXDOMAIN, a successful HTTP response with a 2xx status code is used as long as the DNS response is valid. This is similar to how DoH {{!RFC8484}} handles HTTP response codes. 

In case of server error, the usual HTTP status code 500 (see Section 6.6.1 of {{!RFC7231}}) applies.

# Configuration and Public Key Discovery {#keydiscovery}

In order to use a DoH server as a Target, the client must know a public key to use
for encrypting its queries. This key can be discovered using the SVCB or HTTPSSVC record type
({{!I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https}}) for a name owned by the server.

The Service Binding key name is "odohconfig" ({{iana}}). If present, this key/value
pair contains the public key to use when encrypting Oblivious DoH messages
that will be targeted at a DoH server. The format of the key is defined in ({{publickey}}).

Clients MUST only use keys that were retrieved from records protected by DNSSEC {{!RFC4033}}
to encrypt messages to a Target.

# Configuration and Public Key Format {#publickey}

An Oblivious DNS public key configuration is a structure encoded, using TLS-style
encoding {{!RFC8446}}, as follows:

~~~
struct {
   uint16 kem_id;
   uint16 kdf_id;
   uint16 aead_id;
   opaque public_key<1..2^16-1>;
} ObliviousDoHConfigContents;

struct {
   uint16 version;
   uint16 length;
   select (ObliviousDoHConfig.version) {
      case 0xff04: ObliviousDoHConfigContents contents;
   }
} ObliviousDoHConfig;

ObliviousDoHConfig ObliviousDoHConfigs<1..2^16-1>;
~~~

The `ObliviousDoHConfigs` structure contains one or more `ObliviousDoHConfig` structures in decreasing order of
preference. This allows a server to support multiple versions of Oblivious DoH and multiple sets of Oblivious DoH
parameters.

An `ObliviousDoHConfig` contains a versioned representation of an Oblivious DoH configuration,
with the following fields.

version
: The version of Oblivious DoH for which this configuration is used. Clients MUST ignore any
`ObliviousDoHConfig` structure with a version they do not support. The version of Oblivious DoH
specified in this document is `0xff04`.

length
: The length, in bytes, of the next field.

contents
: An opaque byte string whose contents depend on the version. For this
specification, the contents are an `ObliviousDoHConfigContents` structure.

An `ObliviousDoHConfigContents` contains the information needed to encrypt a message under
`ObliviousDoHConfigContents.public_key` such that only the owner of the corresponding private
key can decrypt the message. The values for `ObliviousDoHConfigContents.kem_id`,
`ObliviousDoHConfigContents.kdf_id`, and `ObliviousDoHConfigContents.aead_id`
are described in {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}} Section 7. The fields in this structure
are as follows:

kem_id
: The HPKE KEM identifier corresponding to `public_key`. Clients MUST ignore any
`ObliviousDoHConfig` structure with a key using a KEM they do not support.

kdf_id
: The HPKE KDF identifier corresponding to `public_key`. Clients MUST ignore any
`ObliviousDoHConfig` structure with a key using a KDF they do not support.

aead_id
: The HPKE AEAD identifier corresponding to `public_key`. Clients MUST ignore any
`ObliviousDoHConfig` structure with a key using an AEAD they do not support.

public_key
: The HPKE public key used by the client to encrypt Oblivious DoH queries.

# Protocol Encoding {#encryption}

## Message Format

There are two types of Oblivious DoH messages: Queries (0x01) and Responses (0x02).
Both messages carry the following information:

1. A DNS message, which is either a Query or Response, depending on context.
1. Padding of arbitrary length which MUST contain all zeros.

They are encoded using the following structure:

~~~
struct {
   opaque dns_message<1..2^16-1>;
   opaque padding<0..2^16-1>;
} ObliviousDoHMessagePlaintext;
~~~

Both Query and Response messages use the `ObliviousDoHMessagePlaintext` format.

~~~
ObliviousDoHMessagePlaintext ObliviousDoHQuery;
ObliviousDoHMessagePlaintext ObliviousDoHResponse;
~~~

An encrypted `ObliviousDoHMessagePlaintext` is carried in a `ObliviousDoHMessage`
message, encoded as follows:

~~~
struct {
   uint8  message_type;
   opaque key_id<0..2^16-1>;
   opaque encrypted_message<1..2^16-1>;
} ObliviousDoHMessage;
~~~

The `ObliviousDoHMessage` structure contains the following fields:

message_type
: A one-byte identifier for the type of message. Query messages use `message_type` 0x01, and Response
messages use `message_type` 0x02.

key_id
: The identifier of the corresponding `ObliviousDoHConfigContents` key. This is computed as
`Expand(Extract("", config), "odoh key id", Nh)`, where `config` is the ObliviousDoHConfigContents
structure and `Extract`, `Expand`, and `Nh` are as specified by the HPKE cipher suite KDF corresponding
to `config.kdf_id`.

encrypted_message
: An encrypted message for the Oblivious Target (for Query messages) or client (for Response messages).

The contents of `ObliviousDoHMessage.encrypted_message` depend on `ObliviousDoHMessage.message_type`.
In particular, `ObliviousDoHMessage.encrypted_message` is an encryption of a `ObliviousDoHQuery`
if the message is a Query, and `ObliviousDoHResponse` if the message is a Response.

## Encryption and Decryption Routines

Clients use the following utility functions for encrypting a Query and decrypting
a Response as described in {{odoh-client}}.

encrypt_query_body: Encrypt an Oblivious DoH query.

~~~
def encrypt_query_body(pkR, key_id, Q_plain):
  enc, context = SetupBaseS(pkR, "odoh query")
  aad = 0x01 || len(key_id) || key_id
  ct = context.Seal(aad, Q_plain)
  Q_encrypted = enc || ct
  return Q_encrypted
~~~

decrypt_response_body: Decrypt an Oblivious DoH response.

~~~
def decrypt_response_body(context, Q_plain, R_encrypted):
  key, nonce = derive_secrets(context, Q_plain)
  aad = 0x02 || 0x0000 // 0x0000 represents a 0-length KeyId
  R_plain, error = Open(key, nonce, aad, R_encrypted)
  return R_plain, error
~~~

The `derive_secrets` function is described below.

Targets use the following utility functions in processing queries and producing
responses as described in {{odoh-target}}.

setup_query_context: Set up an HPKE context used for decrypting an Oblivious DoH query.

~~~
def setup_query_context(skR, key_id, Q_encrypted):
  enc || ct = Q_encrypted
  context = SetupBaseR(enc, skR, "odoh query")
  return context
~~~

decrypt_query_body: Decrypt an Oblivious DoH query.

~~~
def decrypt_query_body(context, key_id, Q_encrypted):
  aad = 0x01 || len(key_id) || key_id
  enc || ct = Q_encrypted
  Q_plain, error = context.Open(aad, ct)
  return Q_plain, error
~~~

derive_secrets: Derive keying material used for encrypting an Oblivious DoH response.

~~~
def derive_secrets(context, Q_plain):
  odoh_secret = context.Export("odoh secret", 32)
  odoh_prk = Extract(Q_plain, odoh_secret)
  key = Expand(odoh_prk, "odoh key", Nk)
  nonce = Expand(odoh_prk, "odoh nonce", Nn)
  return key, nonce
~~~

encrypt_response_body: Encrypt an Oblivious DoH response.

~~~
def encrypt_response_body(R_plain, answer_key, answer_nonce):
  aad = 0x02 || 0x0000 // 0x0000 represents a 0-length KeyId
  R_encrypted = Seal(answer_key, answer_nonce, aad, R_plain)
  return R_encrypted
~~~

# Oblivious Client Behavior {#odoh-client}

Let `M` be a DNS message (query) a client wishes to protect with Oblivious DoH.
When sending an Oblivious DoH Query for resolving `M` to an Oblivious Target with
`ObliviousDoHConfigContents` `config`, a client does the following:

1. Create an `ObliviousDoHQuery` structure, carrying the message M and padding, to produce Q_plain.
1. Deserialize `config.public_key` to produce a public key pkR of type `config.kem_id`.
1. Compute the encrypted message as `Q_encrypted = encrypt_query_body(pkR, key_id, Q_plain)`,
where `key_id` is as computed in {{encryption}}. Note also that `len(key_id)` outputs the length of `key_id`
as a two-byte unsigned integer.
1. Output a ObliviousDoHMessage message `Q` where `Q.message_type = 0x01`, `Q.key_id` carries `key_id`,
and `Q.encrypted_message = Q_encrypted`.

The client then sends `Q` to the Proxy according to {{oblivious-request}}.
Once the client receives a response `R`, encrypted as specified in {{odoh-target}},
it uses `decrypt_response_body` to decrypt `R.encrypted_message` and produce R_plain.
Clients MUST validate `R_plain.padding` (as all zeros) before using R_plain.dns_message.

# Oblivious Target Behavior {#odoh-target}

Targets that receive a Query message Q decrypt and process it as follows:

1. Look up the `ObliviousDoHConfigContents` according to `Q.key_id`. If no such key exists,
the Target MAY discard the query, and if so, it MUST return a 400 (Client Error) response
to the Proxy. Otherwise, let `skR` be the private key corresponding to this public key,
or one chosen for trial decryption.
1. Compute `context = setup_query_context(skR, Q.key_id, Q.encrypted_message)`.
1. Compute `Q_plain, error = decrypt_query_body(context, Q.key_id, Q.encrypted_message)`.
1. If no error was returned, and `Q_plain.padding` is valid (all zeros), resolve
`Q_plain.dns_message` as needed, yielding a DNS message M. Otherwise, if an error
was returned or the padding was invalid, return a 400 (Client Error) response to the Proxy.
1. Create an `ObliviousDoHResponseBody` structure, carrying the message `M` and padding,
to produce `R_plain`.
1. Compute `answer_key, answer_nonce = derive_secrets(context, Q_plain)`.
1. Compute `R_encrypted = encrypt_response_body(R_plain, answer_key, answer_nonce)`.
The `key_id` field used for encryption is empty, yielding `0x0000` as part of the AAD.
Also, the `Seal` function is that which is associated with the HPKE AEAD.
1. Output a `ObliviousDoHMessage` message `R` where `R.message_type = 0x02`,
`R.key_id = nil`, and `R.encrypted_message = R_encrypted`.

The Target then sends `R` in a 2xx (Successful) response to the Proxy according
to {{oblivious-response}}. The Proxy forwards the message `R` without modification
back to the client as the HTTP response to the client's original HTTP request.

# Compliance Requirements {#compliance}

Oblivious DoH uses draft-07 of HPKE for public key encryption {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}.
In the absence of an application profile standard specifying otherwise, a compliant
Oblivious DoH implementation MUST support the following HPKE cipher suite:

- KEM: DHKEM(X25519, HKDF-SHA256) (see {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}, Section 7.1)
- KDF: HKDF-SHA256 (see {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}, Section 7.2)
- AEAD: AES-128-GCM (see {{!I-D.irtf-cfrg-hpke}}, Section 7.3)

# Security Considerations

DISCLAIMER: this is a work in progress draft and has not yet seen significant security analysis.

Oblivious DoH aims to keep knowledge of the true query origin and its contents known to only clients.
As a simplified model, consider a case where there exists two clients C1 and C2, one proxy P, and
one target T. Oblivious DoH assumes an extended Dolev-Yao style attacker which can observe all
network activity and can adaptively compromise either P or T, but not C1 or C2. Once compromised,
the attacker has access to all session information and private key material. (This generalizes to
arbitrarily many clients, proxies, and targets, with the constraints that not all targets and proxies
are simultaneously compromised, and at least two clients are left uncompromised.) The attacker is
prohibited from sending client identifying information, such as IP addresses, to targets. (This would
allow the attacker to trivially link a query to the corresponding client.)

In this model, both C1 and C2 send an Oblivious DoH queries Q1 and Q2, respectively, through P to T,
and T provides answers A1 and A2. The attacker aims to link C1 to (Q1, A1) and C2 to (Q2, A2), respectively.
The attacker succeeds if this linkability is possible without any additional interaction. (For example,
if T is compromised, it may return a DNS answer corresponding to an entity it controls, and then observe
the subsequent connection from a client, learning its identity in the process. Such attacks are out of
scope for this model.)

Oblivious DoH security prevents such linkability. Informally, this means:

1. Queries and answers are known only to clients and targets in possession of the corresponding
response key and HPKE keying material. In particular, proxies know the origin and destination
of an oblivious query, yet do not know the plaintext query. Likewise, targets know only the oblivious
query origin, i.e., the proxy, and the plaintext query. Only the client knows both the plaintext
query contents and destination.
1. Target resolvers cannot link queries from the same client in the absence of unique per-client
keys.

Traffic analysis mitigations are outside the scope of this document. In particular, this document
does not recommend padding lengths for ObliviousDoHQuery and ObliviousDoHResponse messages.
Implementations SHOULD follow the guidance for choosing padding length in {{!RFC8467}}.

Oblivious DoH security does not depend on proxy and target indistinguishability. Specifically, an
on-path attacker could determine whether a connection a specific endpoint is used for oblivious or
direct DoH queries. However, this has no effect on confidentiality goals listed above.

## Denial of Service

Malicious clients (or proxies) may send bogus Oblivious DoH queries to targets as a Denial-of-Service
(DoS) attack. Target servers may throttle processing requests if such an event occurs. Additionally,
since Targets provide explicit errors upon decryption failure, i.e., if ciphertext decryption fails
or if the plaintext DNS message is malformed, Proxies may throttle specific clients in response to
these errors.

Malicious Targets or Proxies may send bogus answers in response to Oblivious DoH queries. Response
decryption failure is a signal that either the proxy or target is misbehaving. Clients can choose to
stop using one or both of these servers in the event of such failure. However, as above, malicious
Targets and Proxies are out of scope for the threat model.

## General Proxy Services

Using DoH over anonymizing proxy services such as Tor would also achieve the desired goal of separating
query origins from their contents. However, there are several reasons why such systems are undesirable
in comparison Oblivious DoH:

1. Tor is also meant as a generic connection-level anonymity system, and thus seems overly complex
and costly for the purpose of proxying individual DoH queries. In contrast, Oblivious DoH is a
lightweight extension to standard DoH, implemented as an application-layer proxy, that can be enabled
as a default mode for users which need increased privacy.

1. As a one-hop proxy, Oblivious DoH encourages connection-less proxies to mitigate client query correlation
with few round-trips. In contrast, multi-hop systems such as Tor often run secure connections (TLS) end-to-end,
which means that DoH servers could track queries over the same connection. Using a fresh DoH connection
per query would incur a non-negligible penalty in connection setup time.
