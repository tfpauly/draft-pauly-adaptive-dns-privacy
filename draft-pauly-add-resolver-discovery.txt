               draft-pauly-add-resolver-discovery-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a method for dynamically discovering resolvers
   that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of
   designating a resolver to be used for a subset of client queries
   based on domain.  This method is intended to work both for locally-
   hosted resolvers and resolvers accessible over the broader Internet.

1.  Introduction

   When clients need to resolve names into addresses in order to
   establish networking connections, they traditionally use by default
   the DNS resolver that is provisioned by the local network along with
   their IP address [RFC2132] [RFC8106].  Alternatively, they can use a
   resolver indicated by a tunneling service such as a VPN.

   However, privacy-sensitive clients might prefer to use an encrypted
   DNS service other than the one locally provisioned in order to
   prevent interception, profiling, or modification by entities other
   than the operator of the name service for the name being resolved.

   Protocols that can improve the transport security of a client when
   using DNS or creating TLS connections include DNS-over-TLS (DoT)
   [RFC7858], DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) [RFC8484], and Encrypted TLS Client
   Hellos [I-D.ietf-tls-esni].

   This document defines a method for dynamically discovering resolvers
   that support encrypted transports, and introduces the concept of
   designating a resolver to be used for a subset of client queries
   based on domain.  This method is intended to work both for locally-
   hosted resolvers and resolvers accessible over the broader Internet.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   This document defines the following terms:

   Direct Resolver:  A DNS resolver using any transport, encrypted or
      unencrypted, that is provisioned directly by a local router or a
      VPN.

   Designated Resolver:  A DNS resolver that is designated as a
      responsible resolver for a given domain or zone.  Designated
      resolvers use encrypted transports.

   Companion DoH Server:  A DNS resolver that provides connectivity over
      HTTPS (DoH) that is designated as equivalent to querying a
      particular Direct Resolver.

3.  Designated Resolvers

   An encrypted DNS resolver, such as a DoH or DoT server, can be
   designated for use in resolving names within one or more zones.  This
   means that clients can learn about an explicit mapping from a given
   domain or zone to one or more Designated Resolvers, and use that
   mapping to select the best resolver for a given query.

   Designating a resolver MUST rely on agreement between the entity
   managing a zone (the Domain Owner) and the entity operating the
   resolver, such that clients can securely validate this designation.
   These entities can be one and the same, or a Domain Owner can choose
   to designate a third-party resolver to handle its traffic.  Proof of



Pauly, et al.            Expires 15 October 2022                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                   April 2022


   this agreement asserts to clients that sending any query to the
   designated resolver exposes no more information than sending that
   query to the entity managing the corresponding zone.

   As an example with only one entity, a company that runs many sites
   within "enterprise.example.com" can provide its own DoH resolver,
   "doh.enterprise.example.com", and designate only that resolver for
   all names that fall within "enterprise.example.com".  This means that
   no other resolver would be designated for those names, and clients
   would only resolve names with the same entity that would service TLS
   connections.

   As an example with several entities, the organization that operates
   sites within "example.org" may work with two different Content
   Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve its sites.  It might designate
   names under "example.com" to two different entities, "doh.cdn-a.net"
   and "doh.cdn-b.net".  These are CDNs that have an existing
   relationship with the organization that runs "example.org", and have
   agreements with that organization about how data with information on
   names and users is handled.

   There are several methods that can be used to discover and validate a
   resolver designation:

   *  Discovery using SVCB DNS records (Section 3.1), and validation
      using DNSSEC

   *  Discovery using information in a provisioning domain (PvD) file
      from the Designated DoH Resolver (Section 3.2)

   *  Validation using a file hosted on a well-known HTTPS URI based on
      a zone apex (Section 3.3)

   *  Validation using TLS certificates to confirm of domain name
      ownership (Section 3.4)

   Note that clients MUST NOT accept designations for effective top-
   level domains (eTLDs), such as ".com".

3.1.  Designating with Service Binding DNS Records

   The primary source for discovering Designated DoH Server
   configurations is from properties stored in a SVCB DNS resource
   record, or a SVCB-conformant resource record type, like HTTPS
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https].  This record provides the URI Template
   of a DoH server that is designated for a specific domain.  A specific
   domain may have more than one such record.




Pauly, et al.            Expires 15 October 2022                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                   April 2022


   The rationale for using SVCB records for resolver discovery is
   discussed in Appendix A.

   In order to designate a DoH server for a domain, a SVCB record can
   contain the "dohuri" (Section 9).  The value stored in the parameter
   is a URI, which is the DoH URI template [RFC8484].

   The following example shows a record containing a DoH URI, as
   returned by a query for the HTTPS variant of the SVCB record type on
   "foo.example.com".

      foo.example.com.  7200  IN HTTPS 1 . (
                              dohuri=https://doh.example.net/dns-query )

   If this record is DNSSEC-signed [RFC4033], clients can immediately
   create a mapping that indicates the server (doh.example.net) as a
   Designated Resolver for the name in the SVCB record
   (foo.example.com).

   Once a record that designated a DoH server has expired, the client
   SHOULD issue another SVCB/HTTPS query whenever issuing queries within
   the designated domain.  This query SHOULD still be performed using
   the designated DoH server.  If the response designates a different
   DoH server, the client should verify and use the new designation.

   If this record is not DNSSEC-signed, clients MUST perform other
   validation to determine that the zone designation is permitted, as
   described in Section 3.3.

3.2.  Additional Designation with PvD JSON

   A provisioning domain (PvD) defines a coherent set of information
   that can be used to access a network and resolve names.  Section 4.3
   of [I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains] defines a JSON dictionary
   format that can be fetched over HTTPS at the well-known URI "/.well-
   known/pvd".

   Designated Resolvers that support DoH SHOULD provide a PvD JSON
   dictionary available at the well-known PvD URI with the path of the
   DoH server's URI template appended.

   For example, the PvD JSON for the DoH server
   "https://doh.example.net/dns-query" would be available at
   "https://doh.example.net/.well-known/pvd/dns-query".







Pauly, et al.            Expires 15 October 2022                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                   April 2022


   The key "dohTemplate" is defined within the JSON dictionary
   (Section 9) to point back to the DoH URI Template itself.  This is
   used for confirming the DoH server when the PvD is discovered locally
   or during zone apex confirmation (Section 3.3).

   Names that are listed in the "dnsZones" key in the JSON dictionary
   indicate a set of zones that designate the resolver.  These are the
   zones that are available to resolve through the associated DoH
   server.  Note that this list does not need to be exhaustive, but is
   the set of common zones managed by the resolver that all clients
   should be aware of.  Before using DNS results for these names,
   clients MUST validate the designation either with a DNSSEC-signed
   SVCB record (Section 3.1), or the confirmation methods described in
   Section 3.3 and Section 3.4.  DNS queries for validating records
   SHOULD be sent to the DoH resolver.  In order to optimize the
   validation of these domains, servers MAY use HTTP Server Push to
   deliver the signed SVCB answers prior to requests being made.

   The "expires" key indicates a time after which the content of the PvD
   file is no longer valid.  Clients SHOULD re-fetch PvD information if
   the expiration time has passed before using any designations that
   were based on the PvD content.

      {
            "identifier": "doh.example.net.",
            "dohTemplate": "https://doh.example.net/dns-query",
            "dnsZones": ["example.com"],
            "expires": "2020-08-23T06:00:00Z"
      }

3.3.  Confirmation of Designation with Zone Apex PvD

   Designated DoH Resolvers that provide the PvD JSON described in
   Section 3.2 can also provide information to validate of zone's
   designation without DNSSEC.  In order to confirm the designation, the
   client requests a well-known HTTPS URI based on a zone apex name, and
   checks a PvD file to ensure that it matches the DoH resolver.  This
   ensures that a DoH resolver cannot claim a designation for a given
   zone without cooperation from the entity that owns the certificate
   for the apex of that zone.

   In order to enumerate the zone apex names that confirm designation in
   this manner, the DoH resolver's PvD JSON dictionary can contain an
   array of strings, with the key "trustedNames".  Clients can validate
   the resolver designation by checking a resource hosted by a name
   indicated in "trustedNames".  The client first issues an HTTP GET
   request by appending "/.well-known/pvd" to the trusted name, using
   the "https" scheme.  In order to validate the designation, the PvD



Pauly, et al.            Expires 15 October 2022                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                   April 2022


   JSON MUST contain a "dohTemplate" key pointing to the correct DoH
   resolver.  The client's query for the IP addresses of the trusted
   name MAY use the DoH resolver prior to fully validating the
   designation, since the validation uses HTTPS to authenticate the
   designation.

   Note that the names listed in "trustedNames" are only useful for
   confirming a designation that was indicated either by a non-DNSSEC-
   signed SVCB designation (Section 3.1), or an additional designation
   provided by the DoH resolver's PvD (Section 3.2).  A trusted name
   MUST be an exact match of a designating name, or else a parent of a
   designating name.

   If a name has more specific sub-domains that should not be allowed to
   designate a given DoH resolver, this method of confirmation MUST NOT
   be used.

   As an example of this process, the JSON dictionary for the DoH server
   "https://doh.example.net/dns-query", which is retrieved from
   "https://doh.example.net/.well-known/pvd/dns-query", could contain
   the following contents:

      {
        "identifier": "doh.example.net.",
        "dohTemplate": "https://doh.example.net/dns-query",
        "dnsZones": ["example.com"],
        "trustedNames": ["example.com"],
        "expires": "2020-08-23T06:00:00Z"
      }

   This indicates that "example.com" should be treated as a designated
   domain, and that it can be validated by checking with the
   "example.com" server rather than using DNSSEC.

   In this example, the well-known URI used for validation is
   "https://example.com/.well-known/pvd".  In order to trust the
   designation, this request must return valid JSON with the
   "dohTemplate" key matching the original DoH resolver.  For example,
   this dictionary could contain the following contents:

      {
        "identifier": "example.com.",
        "dohTemplate": "https://doh.example.net/dns-query",
        "expires": "2020-08-23T06:00:00Z"
      }






Pauly, et al.            Expires 15 October 2022                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                   April 2022


   A client MUST NOT trust a designation if the JSON content is not
   present, does not contain a "dohTemplate" key, or the value in the
   "dohTemplate" key does not match.  The following result would not be
   acceptable for the example above:

   {
     "identifier": "example.com.",
     "dohTemplate": "https://not-the-doh-youre-looking-for.example.net/dns-query"
     "expires": "2020-08-23T06:00:00Z"
   }

   Note that the domains listed in "trustedNames" may be broader than
   the zones that designate the resolver.  In the following example,
   names under "foo.example.com" and "bar.example.com" designate the DoH
   server "https://doh.example.net/dns-query", and use the PvD JSON from
   "example.com" to validate the designation.  However, the client would
   not designate the DoH server for all names under "example.com".

      {
        "identifier": "doh.example.net.",
        "dohTemplate": "https://doh.example.net/dns-query",
        "dnsZones": ["foo.example.com", "bar.example.com"],
        "trustedNames": ["example.com"],
        "expires": "2020-08-23T06:00:00Z"
      }

3.4.  Confirmation of Designation with TLS Certificates

   A DoH server designation can also be validated by checking the
   SubjectAlternativeName field in the DoH server's own TLS certificate.
   When a client wants to confirm the validity of the designation in
   this situation, it can check the TLS certificate of the DoH server
   for the name of the domain which triggered the original designation
   query.

   The following example shows an HTTPS variant of the SVCB record type
   for "foo.example.com".  If this record was received without DNSSEC,
   the client can confirm its validity by establishing a connection to
   "doh.example.net" and verifying the TLS certificate contains an exact
   match for the "foo.example.com" name.  If the queried domain is not
   present in the TLS certificate of the designated DoH server, the
   client may confirm the validity by an alternate method such as zone
   apex confirmation (Section 3.3) but MUST NOT use the record until
   otherwise validated.

      foo.example.com.  7200  IN HTTPS 1 . (
                              dohuri=https://doh.example.net/dns-query )

4.  Explicit Discovery of Local Resolvers

   If the local network provides configuration with an Explicit
   Provisioning Domain (PvD), as defined by
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-provisioning-domains], clients can learn about
   domains for which the local network's resolver is authoritative.  The
   keys for DoH resolvers described in Section 3.2 also allow this local
   PvD to be used for resolver discovery.

   If an RA provided by the router on the network defines an Explicit
   PvD that has additional information, and this additional information
   JSON dictionary contains the key "dohTemplate", then the client
   SHOULD add this DoH server to its list of known DoH configurations.
   The domains that the DoH server claims authority for are listed in
   the "dnsZones" key.

   Local deployments that want to designate a resolver for a private
   name that is not easily signed with DNSSEC MUST provide an alternate
   method of validating a designation, such as described in Section 3.3
   or Section 3.4.

5.  Discovery of DoH Capabilities for Direct Resolvers

   Direct Resolvers can advertise a Companion DoH server that offers
   equivalent services and is controlled by the same entity.  To do
   this, a DNS server returns an SVCB record for "dns://resolver.arpa"
   with "ipv4hint" and/or "ipv6hint" set to a valid IP address and the
   "dohuri" key set to a valid DoH URI template as with the Designated
   DoH Server SVCB record.  The TLS certificate used with the DoH URI
   MUST have the IP addresses for each of its DNS endpoints, classic or
   DoH, within the SubjectAlternativeName field to allow the client to
   verify ownership.

   Once a client is configured to query a Direct Resolver, it SHOULD
   query the resolver for SVCB records for "dns://resolver.arpa" before
   making other queries.  This will help the client avoid leaking
   queries that could go over DoH once the Companion DoH Server is
   discovered.  If an SVCB record is returned, its "dohip" field
   designates an IP address the client can send DoH queries to in lieu
   of sending classic DNS queries to the Direct Resolver.  The "dohuri"
   field contains the DoH URI similarly to the SVCB record for a
   Designated DoH Server.

   To validate the Companion DoH Server and the resolver that advertised
   it are related, the client MUST check the SubjectAlternativeName
   field of the Companion DoH Server's TLS certificate for the original
   resolver's IP address and the advertised IP address for the Companion
   DoH server.  If both are present, the discovered Companion DoH Server



Pauly, et al.            Expires 15 October 2022                [Page 9]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                   April 2022


   MUST be used whenever the original Direct Resolver would be used.
   Otherwise, the client SHOULD suppress queries for Companion DoH
   Servers against this resolver for the TTL of the negative or invalid
   response and continue to use the original Direct Resolver.

   The following example shows a record containing a Companion DoH URI,
   as returned by a query for an SVCB record for "dns://resolver.arpa":

      _dns.resolver.arpa  7200  IN SVCB 1 doh.example.net (
                           ipv4hint=x.y.z.w
                           dohuri=https://doh.example.net/dns-query )

   A DNS resolver MAY return more than one SVCB record of this form to
   advertise multiple Companion DoH Servers that are valid as a
   replacement for itself.  Any or all of these servers may have the
   same IP address as the DNS resolver itself.  In this case, clients
   will only have one IP address to check for when verifying ownership
   of the Companion DoH server.

6.  Server Deployment Considerations

   When servers designate DoH servers for their names, the specific
   deployment model can impact the effective privacy and performance
   characteristics.

6.1.  Single Content Provider

   If a name always resolves to server IP addresses that are hosted by a
   single content provider, the name ought to designate a single DoH
   server.  This DoH server will be most optimal when it is designated
   by many or all names that are hosted by the same content provider.
   This ensures that clients can increase connection reuse to reduce
   latency in connection setup.

   A DoH server that corresponds to the content provider that hosts
   content has an opportunity to tune the responses provided to a client
   based on the location inferred by the client IP address.

6.2.  Multiple Content Providers

   Some hostnames may resolve to server IP addresses that are hosted by
   multiple content providers.  In such scenarios, the deployment may
   want to be able to control the percentage of traffic that flows to
   each content provider.

   In these scenarios, there can either be:

   *  multiple designated DoH servers that are advertised via SVCB DNS
      Records; or,

   *  a single designated DoH server that can be referenced by one or
      more SVCB DNS Records, operated by a party that is aware of both
      content providers and can manage splitting the traffic.

   If a server deployment wants to easily control the split of traffic
   between different content providers, it ought to use the latter model
   of using a single designated DoH server that can better control which
   IP addresses are provided to clients.  Otherwise, if a client is
   aware of multiple DoH servers, it might use a single resolver
   exclusively, which may lead to inconsistent behavior between clients
   that choose different resolvers.

6.3.  Avoid Narrow Deployments

   Using designated DoH servers can improve the privacy of name
   resolution whenever a DoH server is designated by many different
   names within one or more domains.  This limits the amount of
   information leaked to an attacker observing traffic between a client
   and a DoH server: the attacker only learns that the client might be
   resolving one of the many names for which the server is designated.

   However, if a deployment designates a given DoH server for only one
   name, or a very small set of names, then it becomes easier for an
   attacker to infer that a specific name is being accessed by a client.
   For this reason, deployments are encouraged to avoid deploying a DoH
   server that is only designated by a small number of names.  Clients
   can also choose to only allow DoH servers that are associated with
   many names.

   Beyond the benefits to privacy, having a larger number of names
   designate a given DoH server improves the opportunity for DoH
   connection reuse, which can improve the performance of name
   resolutions.

7.  Security Considerations

   In order to avoid interception and modification of the information
   sent between clients and Designated Resolvers, all exchanges between
   clients and servers are performed over encrypted connections, e.g.,
   TLS.

   Malicious adversaries may block client connections to a Designated
   Resolver as a Denial-of-Service (DoS) measure.  Clients which cannot
   connect these resolvers may be forced to, if local policy allows,
   fall back to unencrypted DNS if this occurs.

8.  Privacy Considerations

   Clients must be careful in determining to which DoH servers they send
   queries directly.  A malicious resolver that can direct queries to
   itself can track or profile client activity.  In order to avoid the
   possibility of a spoofed SVCB record designating a malicious DoH
   server for a name, clients MUST ensure that such records validate
   using DNSSEC (Section 3.1), using zone apex confirmation
   (Section 3.3), or using domain names in TLS certificates
   (Section 3.4).

   Even servers that are validly designated can risk leaking or logging
   information about client lookups.  Such risk can be mitigated by
   further restricting the list of resolvers that are allowed for direct
   use based on client policy.

   An adversary able to see traffic on each path segment of a DoH query
   (e.g., from client to a Designated Resolver, and the Designated
   Resolver to an authoritative DNS server) can link queries to specific
   clients with high probability.  Failure to observe traffic on any one
   of these path segments makes this linkability increasingly difficult.
   For example, if an adversary can only observe traffic between a
   client and proxy and egress traffic from a target, then it may be
   difficult identify a specific client's query among the recursive
   queries generated by the target.

   This document adds a parameter to the "Service Binding (SVCB)

   If present, this parameter indicates the URI template of a DoH server
   that is designated for use with the name being resolved.  This is a

   Meaning:  URI template for a designated DoH server

   Reference:  This document.

9.4.  Special Use Domain Name "resolver.arpa"

   This document calls for the creation of the "resolver.arpa" SUDN.
   This will allow resolvers to respond to queries directed at
   themselves rather than a specific domain name.  While this document
   uses "resolver.arpa" to return SVCB records indicating DoH
   capability, the name is generic enough to allow future reuse for
   other purposes where the resolver wishes to provide information about
   itself to the client.

Appendix A.  Rationale for using SVCB records

   This mechanism uses SVCB/HTTPS resource records
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https] to communicate that a given domain
   designates a particular DoH resolver for clients to use for
   subsequent queries to within the domain.

   There are various other proposals for how to provide similar
   functionality.  There are several reasons that this mechanism has
   chosen SVCB records:

   *  Discovering encrypted resolver using DNS records keeps client
      logic for DNS self-contained and allows an operator of a DNS zone
      to define exactly which names should use a given DoH server.

   *  Using DNS records also doesn't rely on bootstrapping with higher-
      level application operations (such as
      [I-D.schinazi-httpbis-doh-preference-hints]).










Pauly, et al.            Expires 15 October 2022               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft               ADNS Discovery                   April 2022


   *  SVCB records are extensible and allow definition of parameter
      keys.  This makes them a superior mechanism for extensibility, as
      compared to approaches such as overloading TXT records.  The same
      keys can be used both for upgrading direct resolvers to DoH
      through an explicit query (Section 5) and for discovering
      designated resolvers when issuing standard HTTPS queries
      (Section 3.1).

   *  Clients and servers that are interested in privacy of names will
      already need to support SVCB records in order to use Encrypted TLS
      Client Hello [I-D.ietf-tls-esni].  Without encrypting names in
      TLS, the value of encrypting DNS is reduced, so pairing the
      solutions provides the largest benefit.

   *  Clients that support SVCB will generally send out three queries
      when accessing web content on a dual-stack network: A, AAAA, and
      HTTPS queries.  Discovering a resolver designation for a zone as
      part of one of these queries, without having to add yet another
      query, minimizes the total number of queries clients send.  While
      [RFC5507] recommends adding new RRTypes for new functionality,
      SVCB provides an extension mechanism that simplifies client
      behavior.
